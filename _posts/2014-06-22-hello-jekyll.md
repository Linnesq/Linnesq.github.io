title: "Goodbye Wordpress, Hello Jekyll!"
---
I currently have a blog at [richardgilmour.co.uk](http://richardgilmour.co.uk) which hasn't really been updated in a while.
The site runs Wordpress on a very, very cheap hosting package. It's a very basic site, but already has become quite slow (due to hosting) and hard to maintain.
I have some plugins that I *need* to prevent hacks and spam, which stopped playing nice with Wordpress around 12 months ago.
Wordpress has failed to update numerous times to the point where I am ready to give up and try something faster and easier to maintain - this!

I am learning a lot at the moment, and I want to get back into blogging so, hopefully, this will be the start of a new era for me!
I became a dad not long ago, so don't expect anything earth-shatteringly amazing, but I do plan to a little, often.
